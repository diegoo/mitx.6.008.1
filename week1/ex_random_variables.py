Express the probability table (also called the probability mass function) pX of random variable X as a Python dictionary. (Your answer should be the Python dictionary itself, and not the dictionary assigned to a variable, so please do not include, for instance, â€œprob_space =" before specifying your answer. You can use fractions. If you use decimals instead, please be accurate and use at least 5 decimal places.)
